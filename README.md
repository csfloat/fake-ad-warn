# WARNING: You may have just clicked on a CSFloat phishing site!

## What is this?

CSFloat does **NOT** advertise via advertising networks, if you clicked on an ad from Google or similar then it was likely a malicious entity.

## What do I need to do?

### 1) If you're an ad policy enforcer

The entity that you're engaging with is NOT csfloat.com and is instead an attacker.

**! You should block their ad !**

## 2) If you're an end-user

We saved you from this click, but in the future, you should avoid clicking any ads on Google or similar until they resolve domain redirect "hacking"
that allows them to spoof the display URL.
